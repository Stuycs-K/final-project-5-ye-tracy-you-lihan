working on sun & sunflower

Suns now drop randomly onto the field in 10 second intervals; fixed the abstract class; grid and menu is now working, double click sunflower and release on a patch of grass to place a sunflower at that spot; sunflowers generate suns every 5 seconds since they were planted; buying sunflowers subtracts suns from currency count (currency display also added) and insufficient suns makes the sunflower option in the menu bar shine red for a frame.
